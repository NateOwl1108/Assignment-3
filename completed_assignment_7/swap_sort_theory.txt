a. Given a list of 5 elements, what’s the least number of swaps that could occur? What about for a list of  n  elements? Explain why.

Zero if the list alreasy is sorted

b. Given a list of 5 elements, what’s the greatest number of swaps that could occur? What about for a list of  n  elements? Explain why.
The greatest number of swaps is 10. A list of of n has the greatest swaps for n(n - 1)/2. This is truefor a lists 1=0, 2=1, 3=3, 4=6, 

For (c) and (d), determine whether the statement is true or false. If true, then explain why. If false, then provide a counterexample.

c. The number of swaps performed by swap sort on each pass is always a decreasing sequence.
True since with every swap, the solution gets closer to being solved and thus require the same or less steps. 
for example [2,1,8,5,4] in the first pass will have 3 swaps while in the second one there will only be one

d. On two consecutive passes, the number of swaps performed by swap sort is never equal.
False because you have only one element swapping for example [1,2,3,4,0,5] in the next pass the set would be [1,2,3,0,4,5] with only one swap and the next one would be [1,2,0,3,4,5] with one swap

[3,-1,-2,-4]
[-1,3,-2,-4]
[-1,-2,3,-4]
[-1,-2,-4,3]
[-2,-1,-4,3]
[-2,-4,-1,3]
[-4,-2,-1,3]
